      <blockquote>
        “I worked for gale from 1974 to 1977. I was 24 when I started and had been working for an advertising photographer in London and needed a change. A friend from college knew the secretary (Lucy) at Gales and was offered a job but didn't have a work permit and told me about the vacancy. I got the job after a quick interview with David Lythe (later of Volt Speakers) and was put onto the production line building the speakers. It was a fun time, being in the middle of Mayfair and reputedly the only factory in the vicinity. Bruton Place was a great road just of Berkeley Square where the nightin-gale sang, Lol. That was i first met Ian Dampney and Nigel Hobden. Donald Sinclair, a whiskey drinking Scott was the speaker manager and many an eving was spent in one of the Mayfair pubs after work. he taught me to drink pints of bitter with a whiskey chaser. The other guys i remember making the speakers were Mo, Dennis and an Indian Guy who's sir name was Patel but I forget his first name. Peter Balkan was the little guy who tested each speaker we made in the anechoic chamber, he was fun when he was fun, but had a wicked temper when he wasn't. Ray was the salesman and had an E-Type Jag I remember. There were three African ladies upstairs who coated the speaker cones, I forget their names but one was a genuine princess.   In time I got promoted upstairs to build the decks and the deck control units which was a bit quieter. I had a dust free chamber to work in and i remember building the control units and calibrating the speeds of the deck using a scope to tweak the crystal which controlled it.   Eventually I remember we were joined by John Curl who was designing the amp. He had worked for Mark Levinson before that I believe and our amp was going to be the best. He was put up in an expensive Mayfair hotel for the duration of hiss stay in London. Typical Ira spending. That amp ended up in bits on the work top. I remember Ray Cooper visiting the workshop and talking to him. I think he is still a friend of Nigel. I also remember looking out of the upstairs window when Oscar Peterson visited, and the guy from Yes.   Ian and Nigel saw the end coming with Gale's as Ira tried to expand, I remember he was going to buy EMI at one point. The started up a Model making business and took me with them and I worked for them for 21 years until the made me redundant! Lol. I'm back in photography now. Did you know that Hi Fi and photography have always been closely linked, don't ask me why.   I remember when Gale went broke and we got paid out in the street in Bruton Place. Then Donald Wong bought the company and a skeleton crew moved to Kensal Rise. That lasted a couple of years I think and I worked for the model making company there. Eventually Donald took production elsewhere and I think dropped the large speakers and went for smaller ones.   I had a silver pair of stands and actually sprayed them black. I think I threw them away eventually, sorry folks. I still have the black and chromes though and they still work ok, the surrounds are probably falling apart but I don't thrash them. I run them from a Quad 303 and the 100W'dumping' amp (Quad 405) still.   I used to do the HiFi shows with Ray, they were fun playing Oxygen by Jean Michael Jarre, Yellow Brick Road and Dark Side of the Moon at high volumes to HiFi 'heads'.   I love the pictures that you have on this site. Have you got the Playboy Mag one's? Or was it another men's mag I forget, I have it somewhere. There was one add of the B&Chrome taken on a stand in a garden with a cat on it. I think they only used it once, have you seen that one? It was my garden, my cat and I took the picture!   jules”

        “Ray was Mr Hi-Fi in the UK during the 70s and 80s… One Saturday a chap asked for directions and left with a Linn LP12,
        a Quad 405/33 and a pair of 401s… Another time, wiring a B&O in Cheyne Walk, Yul Brynner burst in doing kung fu!”
