# GT2101 Turntable

An archive dedicated to the **Gale GT2101** — its schematics, motor control system, photographic records, and original documentation.  
This collection preserves material once hosted on *galeaudio.com* (circa 2011–2016), combined with new research, restored imagery, and verified technical annotations from the community.

  <strong>Archival note:</strong><br>
  The <em>Gale GT2101</em> was one of the most ambitious British turntables of the 1970s — designed by <strong>Design Consultants Associates (DCA)</strong> under <strong>John Carter</strong> for <strong>Gale Electronics</strong>.  
  Its separate stainless-steel motor pod, servo-controlled direct-drive system (developed with Dr. Sao Win), and transparent acrylic architecture made it both a technical and aesthetic landmark.  
  Much of this information was once at risk of being lost when <em>galeaudio.com</em> went offline; this repository ensures it remains permanently preserved for study, restoration, and historical record.
