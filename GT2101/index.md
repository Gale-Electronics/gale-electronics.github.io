# GT2101 Turntable

Archive of the **Gale GT2101** turntable — schematics, motor layouts, photography, and historical documentation.  
This collection preserves material originally published on *galeaudio.com* (circa 2011–2016) alongside new findings, photographs, and technical annotations contributed by the restoration community.

  <strong>Archival note:</strong>  
  The <em>Gale GT2101</em> was one of the most ambitious British turntables of the 1970s, designed by DCA (Design Consultants Associates) for Gale Electronics.  
  Much of the technical information and imagery risked being lost when the original <em>galeaudio.com</em> site disappeared; this section preserves those materials in a permanent, version-controlled archive for research and restoration purposes.
