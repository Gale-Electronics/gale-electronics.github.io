# GT2101 Turntable

The **Gale GT2101** represents one of the boldest moments in 1970s British audio design — a fusion of technical precision and sculptural form.  
This archive documents the engineering, craftsmanship, and creative ambition behind the GT2101 through restored images, schematics, and contemporary research.

  <strong>Archival note:</strong><br>
  The <em>Gale GT2101</em> was designed by <strong>Design Consultants Associates (DCA)</strong> under <strong>John Carter</strong> for <strong>Gale Electronics</strong>, featuring a servo-controlled direct-drive system developed with <strong>Dr. Sao Win</strong>.  
  Its transparent acrylic chassis, separate stainless-steel motor pod, and LED speed display gave it the look of a scientific instrument rather than a domestic turntable.  
  Fewer than a hundred were ever produced — each hand-built in London.  
  When <em>galeaudio.com</em> disappeared, much of this rare documentation risked being lost; this open archive ensures it remains accessible for research, reference, and restoration.
