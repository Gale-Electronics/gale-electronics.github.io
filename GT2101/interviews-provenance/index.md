# GT2101 — Interviews & Provenance

This document preserves the written record from *galeaudio.com*, including commentary from former Gale engineers, collectors, and enthusiasts.  
All images, schematics, and adverts have been omitted for clarity — only verified historical and technical text remains.

## A Revolution in Turntable Design

The audio world was turned upside down by the introduction of the **Gale GT2101 turntable** at Audio Fair, Olympia, London, in October 1974.  
A number of industry icons were instantly dethroned.

It was lust at first sight for the entire audio world, and a Gale turntable on a magazine cover was commonplace — not bad considering they only made around sixty.

It’s hard to put into perspective the effect the GT2101 had on the staid audio world of the 1970s. Here was a turntable more modern than the Transcriptors and Michell decks, yet it outperformed the Linn/Ariston tables sonically — a **direct-drive, non-resonant, advanced-suspension design floating on a magnetic bearing.**

It appeared on the cover of *Stereo Review* (October 1975) and *Playboy* (April 1976), often pictured with an SME 3009 Type II tonearm.

## Design & Production Credits

- **Concept:** Royal College of Art graduate **Kenneth Freivokh**, whose prototype styling set the aesthetic direction. Freivokh later became a world-renowned yacht designer.  
- **Industrial Design:** **David Carter, CBE** (Design Consultants Associates – DCA)  
- **Engineering:** **Nigel Hobden**  
- **Collaborators:** **Ira Gale** and **Dr. Sao Win**, classmates from Harvey Mudd College.  
  - Gale studied music at the Royal Academy of Music.  
  - Win studied at Cambridge and helped co-develop the DC servo system.  
  - They jointly held patents for the design.  

The turntable was produced in very small numbers — approximately **60 to 200 units** — at a cost of **$1,975 USD** (without tonearm).  
It featured **a separate stainless-steel motor pod**, **quartz-locked optical servo system**, and a **floating magnetic bearing**.  
Notable owners reportedly included **J. Paul Getty**, **Elton John**, **Frank Sinatra**, and **Freddie Mercury**.

## Engineering Commentary

**Paul Ramsden (DCA, colleague of Nigel Hobden):**  
> “Nigel and I worked at DCA Design in Warwick, England. I was in the electronics group along with Steve Twitchet; Nigel managed the group.  
> Ira Gale came to DCA with the ‘look’ of the turntable already established but needing help with the electronics and mechanical engineering.  
> Most was done at DCA, though we brought in an outside consultant to stabilise the phase-locked loop (PLL) that locks the motor to the crystal oscillator.  
> Steve laid out the circular PCBs for the control tower by hand with red/green tape on mylar.  
> The motors came as finished Litton units — DCA didn’t handle internals.  
> Documentation stayed with Gale; schematics likely lost.  
> Repair will be hard due to obsolete components. A dedicated engineer could reverse-engineer the logic; chip data may be rare.”

## Technical Highlights

- Dual-layer acrylic plinth connected by three **tri-point suspension towers**.  
- **Top tier:** motor assembly, platter, and tonearm.  
- **Lower tier:** chassis foundation.  
- **Motor:** high-torque **Inland brushless DC**, with a **Litton 600-line optical encoder** and magnetic bearing using **samarium-cobalt magnets**.  
- **Controller:** cylindrical stainless-steel housing with push-buttons and LED display.  
- Variable speed **10 – 99.9 rpm**, with quartz-locked **33.3 rpm** mode.  
- Claimed precision: **speed monitored 600 times per revolution**, correction via servo loop.  
- Custom **Plessey** toroidal transformer and discrete transistor drive section.  
- **Rumble: effectively zero**, no mechanical contact supporting platter weight.

## Notes from Restoration Correspondence

**Simon Y. (Gale Audio site moderator):**  
- Correct suspension foam supplied by *C.B. Frost Ltd* (Birmingham).  
- Proper height: top acrylic plate should sit mid-point within the suspension tower.  
- **Bearing oil:** watch-grade lubricant (formerly whale oil) recommended by the University of Leicester’s Department of Tribology; modern synthetic equivalent used.  
- Production ceased when **David White** purchased Gale Electronics — the turntable project was discontinued despite internal objections.  
- DCA documentation and drawings existed but were scattered after closure.

## “Firsts” Claimed by Gale Electronics

- First **all-acrylic and stainless-steel** turntable.  
- First with **optical-servo speed control**.  
- First **brushless direct-drive** with **floating magnetic bearing**.  
- First minimalist **tri-suspension chassis**.

## Contemporary Recollections

**Marc S. (2011):**  
> “I saw one for sale in California around 1982 – 83 for $1600. The shop is long gone.”

**Darucla (2011):**  
> “I sold two in London. After Thorn closed our shop, the last one went to my friend Steve Grant (of The Animals) for about £250.”

**Vincent Aruofor (2012):**  
> “We sold the turntable and speakers in Lagos, Nigeria in the ‘70s. Hard to believe only 60 were made!”

**Huub (2012):**  
> “John Daly at DCA confirmed their only GT2101 was sold after the Hi-Fi News review. By 2006, one in France fetched €2700 on eBay.”

**Michael Fremer (2012):**  
> “A reader brought one with a Magnepan arm and Koetsu Black. After setup, it sounded smooth and pleasing — not a Continuum Caliburn, but quite fine!  
> Foam inserts intact. I’d replace the arm and polish the acrylic. Thanks for your site — very helpful.”

**Ron Nortrup (2012):**  
> “Been fascinated by it for 37 years! Would be thrilled even to see one in person.”

**Kavi Alexander (2012):**  
> “Friend Sven-Eric Borja had one in the ‘70s. When ‘high end’ was spinning on rubber bands, there was the Gale — advanced and beautiful.  
> Gale → EMT → Paragon → Electro Research A75 → stacked Quads = heaven.”

**Adrian Newitt (2014):**  
> “I wrote the *Hi-Fi News & Record Review* article. I borrowed DCA’s turntable at the time — not sure where it went later.  
> I worked at DCA and knew editor Steve Harris. Pity you didn’t track me down sooner.”

**Robyatt (2014):**  
> “I own **Sao Win’s** personal turntable and have the emails from him to prove it.”

**Emmaco (site owner, 2016):**  
> “I spoke with Dr. Win recently. He’s retired, living in the Santa Barbara area, and still passionate about music and education.”
