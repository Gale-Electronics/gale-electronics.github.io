## 1973 — The GS401 Loudspeaker

The first product, the **Gale GS401**, was engineered by Ira Gale with **David Lyth** (later founder of Volt Loudspeakers) and **Billy Woodman** (later founder of ATC).  
Styling was by **Jon Bannenberg**, whose sculptural approach gave the 401 its distinctive form with chrome end caps and a fully wrapped cloth enclosure.

Early production used US-made CTS 8-inch woofers, later replaced by Gale’s own British-built units. The sealed-box design, paired with Peerless and Celestion drivers, produced a rich, balanced sound that helped the GS401 become one of the most recognisable loudspeakers of the 1970s.  
Revisions followed: the **401A** (chrome end caps), **401B** (walnut cabinet with flat grille) and **401C** (curved grille).

## 1975 — The GT2101 Turntable

The **Gale GT2101**, developed with **John Carter’s DCA Design Consultants**, represented Gale’s most ambitious statement.  
Its transparent acrylic chassis, stainless-steel motor pod and LED speed-display tower reflected the scientific precision of a servo-controlled direct-drive motor system co-developed by **Dr Sao Win** and **Ira Gale**.

Each unit was hand-built in London; fewer than a hundred are known to exist. Today it remains one of the rarest and most visually striking British turntables.

## 1977–1982 — Amplifiers and Later Years

By the late 1970s Gale expanded into amplifiers and accessories, pursuing the same blend of performance and design innovation.  
Production ceased in the early 1980s, but Gale products have since achieved cult status among collectors and listeners.

## Legacy and Preservation

This **Gale Electronics Archive** and the **Vintage Gale** project exist to preserve the technical, visual and historical record of the company’s work — including schematics, PCB layouts, adverts, driver data and interviews with the original engineers.

The archive builds on the decades of support provided by **Dave Smith**, who assisted Gale owners for over forty years. Due to ill health, Dave can no longer continue; the baton has passed to **Matt**, ensuring Gale’s legacy is maintained with the same care and attention to detail.

A memory that captures **Ira Gale’s** character comes from **Ray Churchhouse**, a long-standing UK hi-fi dealer, who recalled Ira visiting his shop in the early 1970s and buying top-end components not to listen to — but to take apart and understand.  
> “I knew he was going to pull it to bits the moment he left the shop,” said Ray. “He wanted to understand every part of it.”

Together, these archives ensure that Gale’s contribution to British hi-fi design remains accessible to restorers, researchers and enthusiasts worldwide.
