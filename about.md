# **About Gale Electronics**

Gale Electronics was a London-based hi-fi company founded in the early 1970s by Ira Gale, an American audio enthusiast who set out to fuse technical excellence with striking industrial design.

## **1973 — The GS401 Loudspeaker**
The first product, the Gale GS401, was engineered by Ira Gale with David Lyth (later founder of Volt Loudspeakers) and Billy Woodman (later founder of ATC).  
The styling was by Jon Bannenberg, the visionary yacht designer whose influence gave the 401 its distinctive sculptural form with chrome end caps and a fully wrapped cloth enclosure.  

Early production used US-made CTS 8-inch woofers, later replaced by Gale’s own British-built drivers. The sealed-box design, paired with Peerless and Celestion units, produced a rich, balanced sound that helped the GS401 become one of the most recognisable loudspeakers of the 1970s.  
Several revisions followed, the **401A**, **401B**, and **401C**, all maintaining the same form but with incremental driver and crossover updates.

## **1975 — The GT2101 Turntable**
The **Gale GT2101** turntable, developed with John Carter’s DCA Design Consultants, embodied the company’s most ambitious design.  
Its transparent acrylic chassis, stainless-steel motor pod and LED speed display tower reflected the scientific precision of its servo-controlled direct-drive motor system, co-developed by Dr Sao Win and Ira Gale.  

Each unit was hand-built in London, and fewer than 100 are known to exist. Today, it remains one of the rarest and most visually striking British turntables ever made.

## **1977 – 1982 — Amplifiers and Later Years**
By the late 1970s, Gale expanded into amplifiers and accessories, applying the same blend of performance and design innovation.  
Production eventually ceased in the early 1980s, but the company’s products have since achieved cult status among collectors and audiophiles.

## **Legacy and Preservation**
This Gale Electronics Archive and the Vintage Gale Project exist to preserve the technical, visual and historical record of the company’s work, including schematics, PCB layouts, adverts, driver data and interviews with the original engineers.  

Together, these archives ensure that Gale’s contribution to British hi-fi design remains accessible to restorers, researchers and enthusiasts around the world.
