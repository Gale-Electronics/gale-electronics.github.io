# About Gale Electronics

Gale Electronics was a London-based hi-fi company founded in the early 1970s by Ira Gale, an American audio enthusiast who set out to fuse technical excellence with striking industrial design.

## 1973 — The GS401 Loudspeaker
The first product, the Gale GS401, was engineered by Ira Gale with David Lyth (later founder of Volt Loudspeakers) and Billy Woodman (later founder of ATC).  
The styling was by Jon Bannenberg, the visionary yacht designer whose influence gave the 401 its distinctive sculptural form with chrome end caps and a fully wrapped cloth enclosure.  

Early production used US-made CTS 8-inch woofers, later replaced by Gale’s own British-built drivers. The sealed-box design, paired with Peerless and Celestion units, produced a rich, balanced sound that helped the GS401 become one of the most recognisable loudspeakers of the 1970s.  
Several revisions followed, the **401A** with chrome end caps, the **401B** with a walnut cabinet and flat grille, and the **401C** with a curved grille front.

## 1975 — The GT2101 Turntable
The **Gale GT2101** turntable, developed with John Carter’s DCA Design Consultants, embodied the company’s most ambitious design.  
Its transparent acrylic chassis, stainless-steel motor pod and LED speed display tower reflected the scientific precision of its servo-controlled direct-drive motor system, co-developed by Dr Sao Win and Ira Gale.  

Each unit was hand-built in London, and fewer than 100 are known to exist. Today, it remains one of the rarest and most visually striking British turntables ever made.

## 1977 – 1982 — Amplifiers and Later Years
By the late 1970s, Gale expanded into amplifiers and accessories, applying the same blend of performance and design innovation.  
Production eventually ceased in the early 1980s, but the company’s products have since achieved cult status among collectors and audiophiles.

## Legacy and Preservation
This Gale Electronics Archive and the Vintage Gale Project exist to preserve the technical, visual and historical record of the company’s work, including schematics, PCB layouts, adverts, driver data and interviews with the original engineers.

The archive builds on the work of Dave Smith, who supported Gale owners for over four decades. Due to ill health, Dave can no longer continue, and the baton has now passed to Matt, ensuring that Gale’s legacy continues with the same care, expertise and attention to detail.

One memory that captures Ira Gale’s character comes from Ray Churchhouse, a long-standing UK hi-fi dealer, who recalled Ira regularly visiting his shop in the early 1970s. Ira would purchase top-end hi-fi equipment not to listen to it — but to take it apart and see how it worked.  
> “I knew he was going to pull it to bits the moment he left the shop,” said Ray. “He wanted to understand every part of it.”  
This curiosity, part audiophile, part engineer, was central to what made Gale’s products so distinctive.

Together, these archives ensure that Gale’s contribution to British hi-fi design remains accessible to restorers, researchers and enthusiasts around the world.
